History Gluon
=====

History Gluon is a database (mainly NoSQL) interface server. It was
originally develop to be used to store history data of ZABBIX (http://www.zabbix.com/).
However, it can be used in other applications, because the APIs are general
for the history data.

The currently supported databases are the following.
 - HBase
 - Cassandra
 - Riak
 - Mem (mainly for test)
