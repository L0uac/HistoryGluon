20121101-001: Fix client-php-ext/Makefile.am
Current implementation uses 'export' in Makefile.am
This may not work with shell other than bash.
The reason why 'export' is used is to pass CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
to configure. This, however, may not be a good way.
Should we set these parameters by client-php-ext/src/config.m4 ?

such as ID and UINT may not be handled correctly.

20121103-001: install history-gluon.ini to php extension setting dir.
Some distros use a directory that contains files to make PHP extensions
load at php boot, such as /etc/php/conf.d on Ubuntu 12.10.
We want to install the file in it.
