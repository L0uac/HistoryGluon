20121101-001: Fix client-lib-php-ext/Makefile.am
Current implementation uses 'export' in Makefile.am
This may not work with shell other than bash.
The reason why 'export' is used is to pass CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
to configure. This, however, may not be a good way.
Should we set these parameters by client-lib-php-ext/src/config.m4 ?
