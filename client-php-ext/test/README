======================
Preparation
======================
(0) install PHPUnit

(1) Enables dynamic loading
Set 'enable_dl = On' in php.ini
  (php.ini is in /etc/php5/cli on Ubuntu 12.10)

(2) install history_gluon.so in extension directory.
This usually is done by executing 'make install' in extension's source directory.

======================
How to test
======================
$ phpunit --colors ApiTest

[Hint] add runtime library path if you do test before the C client library is installed.
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../client-lib-c/.libs phpunit --colors ApiTest.php
